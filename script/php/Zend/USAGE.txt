The Zend_Json plug in have been modified in this way:
	- Replace require_once to this way "require_once 'Zend/Json/..." -> "require_once 'Json/..." for follow the custom PompOView project's structure
	- Rename the Zend/Json.php file to match with the __autoload used to Zend/Zend_Json.php so the class name Zend_Json will be load correctly
